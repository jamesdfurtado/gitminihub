# Note

the "push" function is currently in a MVP-like state. It is only capable of the following:

- Authenticates the user and API key.
- Checks if the specified repository exists for the user.
- Checks if the specified branch exists in the repository.
- Returns a success response if all checks pass.
- Returns appropriate error responses for authentication failure, repository not found, access denied, branch not found, or malformed payload.

No actual commit or branch update logic is performed yet. This is a placeholder for future push functionality.
